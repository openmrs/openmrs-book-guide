# XForms

This chapter will explain and demonstrate the use of the **XForms Module** for patient data entry.

## What an XForm is

XForms is an XML format for specifying a data processing model for XML data and user interface\(s\) for the XML data, such as web forms. XForms was designed to be the next generation of HTML / XHTML forms, but is generic enough to use in a standalone manner or with presentation languages other than XHTML to describe a user interface and a set of common data manipulation tasks.

## What this module does

* Allows data entry to be done directly from any JavaScript enabled browser.

* Enables you to replace the default patient registration form with a custom one **without any programming**.

* Lets you enter observations during patient registration.

* Supports uploading of picture, sound, and video files together and displays and plays them.

* Lets you design XForms using a browser-based form designer.


* Serves OpenMRS forms as XForms to external applications.

* Serves users and patient sets, including medical history, to external applications.

* Accepts form data submitted from external XForms applications.

* Supports creation of patients and entry of observations for both new and existing patients using basic text SMS.


##  What it doesn't do

* Give you as much flexibility as the ﻿HTML Form Entry module when it comes to the form layout and looks.

* Some features present in the HTML Form Entry module are not yet implemented (e.g.: relationships).
