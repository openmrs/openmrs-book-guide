Today, the system has evolved into a medical informatics platform used on nearly every continent, supporting health care delivery and research in an extremely wide variety of contexts.","Our world continues to be ravaged by pandemics of epic proportions, as untold millions of people are infected with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, malaria, and many others. Many of these infections occur in developing countries, where lack of education and resources contribute to scores of preventable deaths. Prevention and treatment interventions on this scale require efficient information management, which is particularly critical as clinical care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, lack of money, or no access to software developers, most health care programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases--if they have any electronic infrastructure at all. Most health care records in the developing world are still maintained on paper.","As a response to these challenges in developing countries, OpenMRS was created as a medical record platform--a rising tide which we hope will lift all ships. It is designed to offer a better tool for information management, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicate efforts. In the years since its inception, the OpenMRS community has grown from a handful of organizations to a massive collaborative effort by both groups and individuals, all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network that allows self-reliance in system development, even in resource-constrained environments.","Since its beginning, OpenMRS has been based on the principles of openness and of sharing ideas, software and strategies for deployment and use. The system is designed to be usable in very resource-poor environments and can be modified with the addition of new data items, forms and reports without the need to write complicated application code. It is intended as a platform that organizations can adopt and modify, avoiding the need to develop a system from scratch.","And indeed, organizations around the world are doing just that. OpenMRS is now in use in clinics in Argentina, Botswana, Cambodia, Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, The Gambia, Uganda, United States, Zanzibar, Zimbabwe, and many other places. This work is supported by many individuals and organizations, including international and government aid groups, NGOs, and for-profit and non-profit corporations.","OpenMRS is not only in use in many different places, but it is also being used to meet many different needs. In Kenya, it is used to support health care delivery for hundreds of thousands of patients at a network of over 50 clinics--some connected by typical networks, but many where the connection requires offline synchronization to external storage that can be physically transported between sites. Another NGO uses a central OpenMRS server connected to clinics in multiple countries via satellite Internet connections. In Malawi, creative individuals with a talent for technology have built a mobile cart running OpenMRS that physicians roll around their clinic, interacting with the system using a touchscreen. In Rwanda, the national ministry of health has worked to roll out a connected national health care system using OpenMRS. In the United States, OpenMRS is used to track patients at large sporting events, for mobile providers of health care to homeless people, and as a personal health record that allows cancer patients to share treatment and home health care information with caregivers and family members.","OpenMRS in use at TRAC Plus Clinic in Kigali, Rwanda.","In the last several years, use of mobile technology has increased dramatically, particularly in the developing world. In some developing countries, there are more mobile phones than people! Facilitated by other open source projects, OpenMRS can be integrated with SMS messaging, allowing community health workers to add information about adherence to medication regimens to a patient's record, as they make rounds through villages in rural Africa. Elsewhere, mobile phone applications are used to guide these community volunteers in home-based HIV testing and counseling, enrolling prospective patients from the comfort of their own homes.","Besides clinical care, the platform can also be used in research settings. In the United States, OpenMRS has been used both in training medical informatics students, as well as in conducting various research projects in the fields of public health. In Peru OpenMRS is used as the research database for a large study of drug resistant tuberculosis funded by the US National Institutes of Health. Because the system has been designed as an extensible platform, it is very easy for researchers to adapt OpenMRS to do what they need."]}],[{"l":"A Brief History","p":["As both the OpenMRS application and open source community grew, they gathered the attention of many other large projects and agencies. Some of these have extended both financial and consulting support over the past several years, including:","At the close of 2011, the OpenMRS community is preparing to launch an independent not-for-profit organization to help support the project's needs as it grows. The goal of this organization will be to provide technical infrastructure and community management, to assist collaboration and cooperation of project volunteers throughout the world, and to provide training and support to those who seek to implement OpenMRS as a key part of a medical informatics strategy in clinics, hospitals, and government health organizations.","At the same time, a Boston-based non-profit named Partners In Health (PIH) was pioneering the use of web-based EMRs in developing countries. They had built the PIH-EMR, which they were using to support the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Peru and HIV in Haiti. But Hamish Fraser, PIH's director of the EMR project, was worried: PIH was about to expand into Rwanda, Lesotho, and Malawi, and he feared it would be difficult to maintain their home-built system in 5 countries.","Because of the strong cooperation between PIH and Regenstrief and the long distances involved, it became clear that an open source software model of development was the best way to sustain and grow the platform, and the OpenMRS project was born.","Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC)","From its humble beginnings as a solution to a problem in a small African town, OpenMRS has become the largest open source health care project on the planet. Between 2006 and 2011, OpenMRS at AMPATH in Kenya has recorded over 111,000,000 points of data for over 180,000 patients, helping to save many thousands of lives. Every day, similar stories are retold somewhere else around the world with the assistance of thousands of volunteers. The OpenMRS community continues to grow, and we are excited that you're interesting in joining us. Regardless of your background or interests, there is a way for you to both contribute and gain from the work of others in the OpenMRS community.","Further, collaborations with other open source software organizations such as Open Data Kit and Pentaho have produced volunteer contributions to OpenMRS, and commercial consulting organizations such as ThoughtWorks Inc. have contributed many hours to developing and improving OpenMRS.","In an effort to broaden participation in the project around the world, OpenMRS began participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program in 2007. GSoC provides university students who wish to participate in open source development projects with a stipend and a close mentoring relationship with an experienced project team member. Participation in the program has continued since then--OpenMRS is now one of the larger open source projects in the program, boasting a large class of alumni, a number of whom continue to contribute to the project. Many of these alumni come from the developing world, and some have gone on to successful software development careers.","In February 2004, the amount of data had become too large for AMPATH's existing systems, so their medical director invited Burke Mamlin, from the Regenstrief Institute in Indianapolis, United States, to visit the site and evaluate how improvements in medical informatics technology could improve AMPATH's data management. Regenstrief had long been recognized as a leader in medical informatics research, and Burke brought his colleague Paul Biondich along with him on the visit to Kenya. It quickly became apparent that a new system was needed. Paul and Burke began to design the data model for a new medical records system for AMPATH, which would go on to become OpenMRS.","In September 2004, Paul and Burke met Hamish at the World Congress on Medical and Health Informatics (MedInfo) conference in San Francisco. It became apparent that the three shared similar goals and needs, so they agreed to work collaboratively to develop a system that would be suitable for the various needs of humanitarian work in African nations and beyond.","National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Centre","One of OpenMRS' birthplaces – Moi University Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya (2004)","One of the aims of the OpenMRS community is to help build local capacity in the places where it is used. To that end, participants in the community are encouraged to develop programs and processes that encourage entrepreneurship and the creation of partnerships to grow the field of medical informatics, particularly in the developing world. For example, in Kigali, Rwanda, Partners In Health jump-started a local training program known as E-Health Software Development and Implementation (EHSDI). This 9-month course conducted in partnership with the Rwanda Development Board and the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) was designed to teach students to develop medical information systems. It includes extensive training in using the OpenMRS platform.","Paul and Burke hired developer Ben Wolfe to begin work on programming an early prototype of OpenMRS, based on their previous work at AMPATH and Regenstrief. Several months later, PIH's lead developer Darius Jazayeri joined the project, merging PIH-EMR's functionality into the new system. The previous systems at AMPATH focused on data entry, while at PIH, the focus was more on clinical workflow. The new system combined features of both the AMPATH and PIH systems.","The inaugural OpenMRS Implementers Meeting in Cape Town, South Africa.","The Millennium Villages Project of the Earth Institute, Columbia University","The number of individual and organizational volunteers who participate in the OpenMRS community has continued to grow, tripling in size between 2010 and 2011. These individuals participate in various ways, from documentation and bug reports, from training and providing support to other community members. The release of OpenMRS 1.8 was made possible by the assistance of over 50 contributors.","The Rockefeller Foundation","The United States Center for Disease Control (CDC)","Throughout the 1990s, an academic partnership flourished between Indiana University School of Medicine in the United States and Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya, providing Kenyan medical students with access to health care training. This program continued to grow for several years until a severe outbreak of HIV/AIDS in Western Kenya caused the program to rethink its goals, at which point the Academic Model for Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS (AMPATH) was created. The number of patients in Kenya continued to grow, and basic IT systems including Microsoft Access were used to monitor patient care.","While the collaboration between Regenstrief and PIH continued and the new system was being designed, the groups were looking for additional support in Africa. They turned to their colleague Chris Seebregts, from the South African Medical Research Council (MRC). Chris was already heavily involved in the field of medical informatics throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and brought with him a wealth of knowledge about the needs of informatics implementations. Seebregts had been adapting OpenMRS for use in South Africa and started to build up a community of implementers of the software around the world. His work led to massive growth of the OpenMRS community (now nearly 2,000 strong as of late 2011). In February 2006, AMPATH launched OpenMRS in Kenya, and PIH brought it to Rwinkwavu, Rwanda, in August of the same year. The South African MRC first switched on the system at Richmond Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal at the end of 2006.","World Health Organization"]},{"i":"whats-new-in-version-19","l":"What's New in Version 1.9","p":["This version of OpenMRS includes a new concept, Visit.

In earlier releases, only Person could be customized. Now, you can also customize Provider, Visit, and Location data.","Concept Mapping has been improved in this release, now allowing you to define how your system's concepts relate to external concepts and standards."]}],[{"l":"Planning"}],[{"i":"example-amani-clinic","l":"Example: Amani Clinic","p":["We assume if you're reading this book that you're interested in deploying OpenMRS to support clinical care in the real world. To bridge the divide between theory and practice, and to illustrate the sometimes challenging process of deploying a large health-care information system, we have used the example of the fictional Amani Clinic as a case study throughout this book.","Every time you see this image in the book, you will learn how Amani Clinic used the information discussed to plan and implement OpenMRS.","While a single example could never possibly capture all the complexity of the many different contexts in which OpenMRS might be used, we hope it will serve as inspiration to think about how your environment may be similar or different. We also hope that as you read, you will start to consider the questions you need to ask to begin to design and implement your own installation of OpenMRS."]},{"l":"About the Amani Clinic","p":["Kisiizi is a small town in southwest Uganda, over 40 kilometers from the nearest large city. Much of the fame of Kisiizi is based on its hydroelectric power generating station and its relatively large hospital, which handles most of the health care for the region.","Just over two years ago, a European-based NGO provided funding to help launch a new health care facility we'll call \"Amani Clinic\" in the town. This clinic was opened specifically to address the need for maternal and child health (MCH) care in Kisiizi and the surrounding areas.","Since its opening, the clinic has been very successful in establishing itself, and has attracted a full staff of doctors, nurses, and assistants. New patients, both pregnant women and new mothers, are continually being registered in the clinic, but there is very little information available about the efficacy of the work in the clinic, or the outcomes for its patients. Therefore, the funding agency has requested that the clinic work to implement an information system, to help better monitor and evaluate the health care outcomes of the patients over time, and to help the clinic scale up to see more patients more efficiently. The agency recommended that the clinic consider using OpenMRS, which had been successfully used by other projects funded by that agency in other countries.","The funding model provided for some information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to get the project started, as well as for some staffing support. However, deciding how to allocate this money was left up to the clinic's local management. After receiving the grant funding, the director of the site hired Claudine, a graduate of a medical informatics training program in neighboring Rwanda, to help lead the effort. This newly-hired informatics manager, in turn, hired Daniel, recent university graduate from Kampala with expertise in ICT infrastructure and system administration.","Since the clinic was opened, doctors and nurses have used paper forms to collect data about their patients. These forms are stored in folders and kept in a locked file room until a patient's appointment. When the patients arrive, they are given their folder to carry with them as they talk with the various health care providers they will see during their visit. Each of these providers completes the relevant paper forms to add information about the visit. The forms are added to the patient's folder, which is returned at the end of their visit.","Clinical staff were concerned when they heard about the upcoming deployment of OpenMRC, because of the possibility of changes to the way they are used to working. However, the informatics manager has assured them that they can continue to use the familiar paper forms. When a patient arrives at the clinic, they will be registered by a patient registration clerk. After the patient's visit is complete, a data entry clerk will enter the information from that visit into OpenMRS.","Many people in Kisiizi have basic ICT skills, and there is a local Internet cafe, supported by an NGO that provides basic ICT training to local residents. Two recent students have been hired as the first patient registration and data entry clerks for the clinic.","Meanwhile, the system administrator has finished his preparation work and has deployed a basic local area network (LAN) to connect a server that will host the OpenMRS application to PCs in the file room, in the clinic manager's office, and in the ICT room. The LAN is connected to the Internet, although the connection isn't very fast and often goes offline. The server is powered by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), that will ensure it stays running despite any fluctuations in the local power grid.","Through the rest of this book, you will follow the progress of the people at the Amani Clinic as they install OpenMRS, customize it to fit the needs of their clinic, and use OpenMRS from day to day, first to enter data and then to extract it for patient visits and for reporting to their funding agency on an ongoing basis."]}],[{"l":"Identifying Your Needs","p":["Discussing requirements and needs at TRAC Plus clinic in Kigali.","This chapter covers some basic strategies for identifying your organizational needs, and how OpenMRS might help. It does not go into detail about what OpenMRS does or how it stores data -- you will find that in other chapters. Instead, we encourage you to first take a step back and think about your organization."]},{"l":"Your organizational goals and practices","p":["For now, forget about technology and instead think about your organizational goals and processes. Here's a list of questions to start:","What are the high-level goals of your organization?","What are the teams and staff in the clinic? What roles exist? What functions does each role perform?","What tasks are staff involved with on a day-to-day basis?","What services does the clinic provide to your patients? What activities are involved?","What other 3rd-party or government organizations do you report to? What information is included in each of these reports?","Answering these questions will probably help you think of more related questions. Make sure you consider them thoroughly."]},{"l":"Take advantage of institutional knowledge","p":["As you think about your patients and how they interact with your organization, talk to your clinical and administrative staff--both those who have been around a long time, and those who have just joined. Talk to as many people as possible to get a complete picture of every service provided to patients.","People generally want to be positive in describing their work places, so you may need to ask some people multiple times. Get physical or electronic copies, or pictures of all paper forms if possible. Figure out where (e.g., specific rooms and desks) data is recorded onto paper and by whom. Write an overview of current practices and define specific shortcomings that could be addressed by using an electronic medical records system.","Note that practices may vary seasonally, for example if the hospital is much busier due to increased malaria during rainy season or malnutrition before harvest."]},{"l":"Map your needs to OpenMRS","p":["OpenMRS has been designed to be flexible and adaptable, based on input from many different partners, but it may not be an exact fit for the ways that your organization currently works. Doing things the \"OpenMRS way\" could mean adapting your workflow and adopting best practices in medical informatics. Be pragmatic and flexible, and think about whether your current working practices might need to change.","Remember that OpenMRS offers many opportunities to capture and analyze information in new ways not previously possible. Taking advantage of these new possibilities might lead to positive changes and improvements for your organization."]},{"i":"do-not-reinvent-the-wheel","l":"Do not \"reinvent the wheel\"","p":["The open source nature of OpenMRS extends beyond application itself to a much larger open community where ideas and experiences are shared.

You should explore the following resources before building anything new."]},{"l":"Reuse an existing concept dictionary","p":["A well-constructed, mature concept dictionary (see the \"OpenMRS Information Model\" chapter) is a strong foundation for any OpenMRS Implementation.","The Millenium Villages Project (MVP) maintains a well-curated concept dictionary. If this dictionary is applicable to your domain of care, you should strongly consider using it. The best way to learn about this dictionary is through a partner project, the Maternal Concept Lab.","http://om.rs/book-mcl","Other OpenMRS implementers can also help advise you about other concept references for your domain. Read the \"Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community\" chapter for more information."]},{"l":"Adapt existing forms","p":["Implementers should evaluate data collection forms built by other OpenMRS users before creating new custom forms for their specific needs.","Implementers across the OpenMRS community have invested a lot of resources in ensuring that their forms reflect clinical best practices, international standards, and current research. These forms have already been optimized for electronic data entry. Many OpenMRS partners develop forms using medical informatics experts that may not be available to all projects. Finally, creating forms is time consuming; those resources could be redirected to other efforts.","The OpenMRS Form Bank is a new community-driven project that is beginning to collect existing forms from other users.

Read the \"Customizing OpenMRS with Plug-in Modules\" chapter for a list of recommended modules."]},{"l":"Amani discovers their specific needs","p":["Once the clinic determined they would use OpenMRS, they began thinking specifically about how they would integrate their existing processes into the workflow supported by the software. As the newly-hired medical informatics manager, Claudine knew she should speak with everyone working in the clinic and watch them during a typical day to understand how they work. When she spoke to them, she assured them that OpenMRS would help to make their work easier, and they would still be using the same overall processes they were familiar with.","Claudine found many resources within the OpenMRS community, including pre-existing concept dictionaries and forms that had been used in other clinics. She was able to take these artifacts and adapt them to Amani's paper forms already in use. Starting out with the work of others saved quite a bit of time."]}],[{"l":"Transitioning to OpenMRS","p":["A paper-based patient register book at an African OpenMRS clinic.","This chapter outlines steps that typically make up a OpenMRS project, and should be read by people about to embark on a OpenMRS implementation. Some of this information may be obvious to experienced project managers. A comprehensive guide to project management is beyond the scope of this book, but we have included some high-level process considerations to get you started thinking about what needs to happen.","We recommend you try to build a structured implementation process. It's important to plan carefully--the decisions you make during this process require substantial investments of resources, and you will be living with your choices for the foreseeable future.","When you start out on a new OpenMRS project, you should spend time thinking about (at minimum):","Which people will be involved in the project","Business goals of using OpenMRS","How you will approach the initial configuration","What ongoing support you will need","Costs associated with ICT infrastructure","Training and documentation","Change management"]},{"l":"People and the project team","p":["Your project implementation team should include clinic staff:","Management are aware of funding obligations and third party reporting requirements.","Health care providers are focused on improving patient care.","Administrative staff are specialists of workflow issues and clinic processes.","The team could also include the following people that may or may not be from the clinic:","A system administrator is in charge of installing and maintaining OpenMRS inside of the clinic's ICT infrastructure.","Medical informatics expert(s) create clinical documentation and ensure that data is managed properly in the system. Develop reports.","(Optional) A project manager or coordinator. For larger implementations, this person works to hold people accountable to finishing their work in a timely manner, and ensures the project is on track.","(Optional) Software developers may be needed for locations that decide to customize the system.","It is very important to include clinical staff (for example nurses, data entry clerks, and others) in your implementation team from the earliest phases of the project so that the resulting deployment is useful for them and easy for them to use.","Managing an OpenMRS project will require a major time investment from people within your organization, even if you employ an external consultant. Organizations often underestimate the amount of time that will be required from their staff in implementing an enterprise ICT project. This time investment includes items such as training, modifying existing processes, and providing new or updated information to relevant people. Deploying OpenMRS is no different. It's not something that can be added to the end of an already busy schedule, and we urge you to keep this in mind and take it into consideration when planning."]},{"l":"Goals","p":["By this point in the project, you should have a good idea of what indicates a successful OpenMRS implementation for your clinic. This could be something like reducing time to prepare month-end reports by 50%, or increasing antiretroviral treatment (ART) in HIV-infected pregnant women by 25%. Your goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely--or SMART.","These goals will help you in directing and managing your project. For example, if the project group wants some customization that requires budget and effort, your overall goals will help you decide whether or not to consider that customization. Your goals will help you to focus on why you are implementing OpenMRS and what you want to achieve in the long run."]},{"l":"Incremental adoption","p":["It often makes sense to divide the implementation process into smaller, more manageable sections, which can be implemented in discrete stages or iterations. Implementing in stages allows people to get used to changes gradually without feeling overwhelmed, and allows your implementation team to be responsive to feedback from users during the process.","Another reason people choose to develop iteratively is that it is very hard for users to correctly or fully explain their requirements at the beginning of the project. Giving people hands-on experience of an early version of the system helps them understand how it works and what might be possible. They can then provide you with valuable feedback, and they might identify new requirements.","The Amani Clinic chose to introduce change iteratively. First they started using the system for patient registration. This affected only the administrative staff without impacting the clinical staff. Later they started doing retrospective data entry, which included paper forms for clinicians that had minor changes, as well as training a new data entry clerk."]},{"l":"Pilot projects","p":["Larger multi-site implementations may wish to develop a pilot approach to help reduce risk. In this scenario, you would only deploy OpenMRS at one site and learn about the process in a more controlled way. You can then incorporate what you've learned into a coordinated implementation process for other sites."]},{"l":"Ongoing support and development","p":["It is a mistake to think about an OpenMRS project as a one-off installation that will meet the needs of your organization for the foreseeable future. Organizations are always changing and evolving. Your medical record system should evolve with you, otherwise it will eventually become out of sync with the organization.","Once you have been using OpenMRS for a while and staff are comfortable with it, you will likely want to take advantage of additional functionality. Each improvement or new piece of functionality you decide to implement in OpenMRS will take resources, so you will want to plan ahead for these.","Even if your organizational needs don't change, you need to plan for ongoing support of OpenMRS, including:","Keeping your system up-to-date with security patches","Upgrading to the latest version of OpenMRS (not always necessary, but OpenMRS is continually improving usability and adding functionality)","Upgrading the modules you use to fix bugs and improve features","Maintenance of your server and network infrastructure","For more information, see the \"Maintenance\" chapter."]},{"l":"Training","p":["Training is also an important part of any OpenMRS implementation project. Your training could take many forms depending on the needs of your users, but it often makes sense to spend resources (e.g., time and money) on formal and reusable training resources such as user guides, lesson plans, and other materials.","Trying to cover everything in one training session probably won't be effective. People will want and need time to digest the new ideas they learn and use them in their daily work, and you must anticipate staff turnover. Instead, consider holding smaller training sessions that introduce concepts and specific functionality, followed by periods of testing, piloting and feedback. Customize your training for your audience--not everyone needs to sit through a two-hour training session on data entry if only a single person is responsible for this role. When possible, train people to become trainers. This increases peoples' sense of ownership in your OpenMRS implementation, and helps people to better remember what they learn.","Training is an ongoing process. New employees will need to be trained when they start, and people familiar with the system can benefit from learning about more advanced topics. People may need further training when there are significant upgrades or new functionality is added to OpenMRS."]},{"l":"Change management","p":["Introducing an electronic medical record system will cause changes in workflow and processes at your organization. These changes may be \"political\" and cause challenges in your organization, or they may be more practical and technical changes. Either way, too much change at the same time is often difficult and stressful.","To help, give people time to accept and support each change so that they share in ownership of the new system, rather than feeling as if something has been forced on them. Focus on simple tasks at the beginning of deployment and introduce more difficult tasks as people start to better understand OpenMRS. Show staff how the new system will make their work easier and where their feedback has been incorporated.","Good planning can minimize the risks around change, but it is important to be flexible within your plan.

After doing so, she downloaded the ** openmrs.war ** file and installed it in the Tomcat application server. Excluding download time for the software, she was able to complete the process in less than one hour."]}],[{"l":"OpenMRS Information Model","p":["Reference books line a shelf in a rural African clinic.","This chapter explains terms and concepts which are useful to understand as you install and use OpenMRS."]},{"l":"Data","p":["The actual information you want to record in OpenMRS is called Data. Examples of Data in OpenMRS are Patients, Encounters, and Observations. To support this data, and describe its meaning, you need additional Metadata.","When a user deletes a piece of data in OpenMRS, the information actually remains in the database. It is marked as voided, so that it will not show up in the interface, but it is not immediately deleted from the database. If a user deletes a piece of data by accident, an administrator canunvoid it to return it to the system. To permanently delete data from the database, an administrator must purge that data. Typically, this should never be done in a production system."]},{"l":"Metadata","p":["The fundamental expectation of OpenMRS's design is that you will customize it for your clinical program's use case. The system has no built-in idea of the patient's weight or seeing the patient in an outpatient visit. Instead, you can configure these things yourself, to match your project's workflow. Generally speaking, the things that you need to configure in order to describe the real patient information you will be capturing are referred to as metadata. An example of a piece of metadata is a Location that represents a hospital.","An administrator may also retire metadata in OpenMRS. This does not mean that the metadata is deleted, but rather that it is not intended to be used going forward. Old information that refers to the retired metadata remains valid. An administrator may unretire metadata if it becomes relevant to active use again. If no actual data refers to a piece of metadata, an administrator may purge the metadata to permanently remove it from the database.","For example, the hospital you refer patients to closes. Therefore, you can no longer refer patients there. This Location can now be retired in OpenMRS. This would not invalidate the fact that many patients were referred there in the past."]},{"l":"Concepts and concept dictionary","p":["The most important part of the system's metadata is the Concept Dictionary, which is a list of all the medical and program-related terms that you will use as questions and answers in Observations. This dictionary does not need to be complete when you begin using OpenMRS. You should expect new terms to be added and old terms to be retired as your use of the system evolves. It is better to start with a pre-populated Concept Dictionary, rather than starting from scratch yourself. See the chapter \"Sharing Concepts and Metadata\" for more details.","Every question you ask about a patient needs to be defined by a Concept. (For example, to record a patient's weight you need a concept like Weight in kilograms.)","If you want to ask a question that has a fixed set of coded answers, those answers are also Concepts. (For example, the question concept Blood Type may have 4 different answer concepts: A, B, AB, and O)"]},{"l":"Persons","p":["Every individual who is referred to in a patient record in OpenMRS is stored in the system as a Person. These include Patients, any patient relative or caretaker, Providers, and Users.","All Persons have these characteristics."]},{"l":"Names","p":["A person can have one or more names, one of which must be marked as the preferred name. The preferred name will be displayed in search results and patient screens."]},{"l":"Addresses","p":["A person may have zero or more contact addresses. You may configure the format of these addresses for your particular locale."]},{"l":"Person Attributes","p":["To support your local needs, you can define additional pieces of information about the people in your system, on top of those that are natively supported by OpenMRS. You can define the datatype of a Person Attribute, as well as any constraints on the possible values, using metadata. This metadata is called a Person Attribute Type.","Person Attributes are suitable for storing other information. But historical values of person attributes are not retained. For example, you should use a person attribute to record a patient's contact telephone number. This information may change, but if it does so, the system need only store the most recent value, and need not retain previous values. It is not appropriate to use a person attribute to store something like the patient's height, which is recorded at a given point in time, but can be expected to change and should be tracked as it does so."]},{"l":"Patients","p":["Anyone who receives care in OpenMRS must be a Patient(for example, anyone who has an Encounter or who is enrolled in a Program). Every Patient must have at least one Identifier, which is explained below.","A Patient is also a Person, meaning they must have at least one name and they may have addresses."]},{"l":"Patient Identifier","p":["The Patient Identifier is a medical record number assigned by your facility, used to identify and re-identify the patient on subsequent visits.","A Patient Identifier Type defines the format of a particular kind of patient identifier. For example, you might define thatAmani ID is an identifier type that is required for every patient; the format is 2 letters followed by 6 digits and uses a particular check digit algorithm.","A Check Digit is an extra digit that is added to the end of an identifier, and depends on the rest of the identifier. It allows OpenMRS to determine whether an identifier has been mistyped. For example using a Luhn check digit, \"1234-1\" is valid, but \"1234-5\" is incorrect. It is a strongly recommended best practice to use check digits in all patient identifiers that you assign. For more information about check digits, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit."]},{"l":"Relationships","p":["A Relationship is a bidirectional link between two Persons in OpenMRS.","The metadata that describes a particular kind of relationship is a Relationship Type. It defines the names of each direction of the relationship. Typical Relationship Types are Parent/Child and Doctor/Patient.","At the Amani Clinic, it is necessary to use relationships to link a mother's patient record to the patient record of her children. One might also use relationships to record the link between a patient and their primary care provider."]},{"l":"Visits","p":["AVisit in OpenMRS represents exactly what it sounds like: a time period when a patient is actively interacting with the healthcare system, typically at a location. The metadata differentiating different types of visits is a Visit Type. Visit Types are displayed in the user interface, and can be searched against.","A visit contains encounters, which store more granular data about treatments or services.","At the Amani Clinic, a patient might typically check-in at registration, be seen by a doctor, and receives medication dispensed in the pharmacy. This would be recorded as one visit of type of Outpatient, and contain three encounters ( Registration, Consultation, and Dispensing)."]},{"l":"Encounters","p":["A moment in time where a patient is seen by providers at a location, and data are captured. Generally speaking, every time you enter a form in OpenMRS this creates an Encounter. Encounters typically belong to a visit, but they may also stand alone.","The metadata that describes a kind of encounter is an Encounter Type. These are displayed in the user interface, and you may also search against them.","During a typical Amani Clinic Outpatient Visit, a patient checks in at registration, is seen by a doctor, and receives meds dispensed in the pharmacy. This would be recorded as one visit containing three encounters, whose types are Registration, Consultation, and Dispensing."]},{"l":"Providers","p":["A Provider is a person who provides care or services to patients. A provider may be a clinician like a doctor or nurse, a social worker, or a lab tech. Generally speaking, any healthcare worker that a patient can have an encounter with is a provider.","Providers may have full records in OpenMRS as persons, or they may just be a simple name and ID number."]},{"l":"Locations","p":["A Location is a physical place where a patient may be seen.","Locations may have a hierarchy, for example Children's Ward might be a location within the location Amani Clinic.","You might also store physical areas (for example Eastern Province, or California) as Locations. You should not use locations to represent logical ideas like All District Hospitals."]},{"l":"Observations","p":["An Observation is one single piece of information that is recorded about a person at a moment in time.","Every observation has a Concept as its question, and depending on the datatype of the concept, it has a value that is a number, date, text, Concept, etc.","Most of the information you store in OpenMRS is in the form of Observations, and most Observations happen in an Encounter. When you enter a form in OpenMRS, typically one Encounter is created with anywhere between tens or hundreds of Observations.","Note that an individual Observation is valid only at one moment in time, and it does not carry forward. You may query the system for the last observation for pregnancy status but this does not tell you whether or not the patient is pregnant at any point after the moment of that observation.","Examples of observations include Serum Creatinine of 0.9mg/dL or Review of cardiopulmonary system is normal."]},{"l":"Observation groups","p":["Sometimes a single Observation is not sufficient to capture an entire piece of patient information, and you need to use multiple Observations that are grouped together.","For example, recording that a patient had a rash as an allergic reaction to penicillin would need to be stored as two observations plus a third one that groups the previous two together:","Concept = \"Allergen\", coded value = \"Penicillin\", group = (3)","Concept = \"Reaction\", coded value = \"Rash\", group = (3)","Concept = \"Allergic Reaction Construct\", group members = (1), (2)"]},{"l":"Orders","p":["An Order is an action that a provider requests be taken regarding a patient.","For example a provider could order a Complete Blood Count laboratory panel for a patient.","An Order only records an intention, not whether or not the action is carried out. The results of an Order are typically recorded later as Observations.","Prescribing a medication is a Drug Order. A drug order can be placed for a generic drug, represented by a Concept (for example, 500mg of Ciprofloxacin, twice a day). If you are using OpenMRS to manage a formulary of specific medications (i.e., Drugs in OpenMRS), you may also record Drug Orders against those. For example, a drug order might be One 500mg tablet of Ciprofloxacin, twice a day."]},{"l":"Allergy lists","p":["OpenMRS lets you manually maintain an Allergy List for a patient, including the allergen, reaction, severity, etc.","This list is managed separately from Observations: observing an allergic reaction to a drug does not automatically add an Allergy to the list.","Unlike an Observation (which happens at one moment in time), an Allergy is longitudinal data, with start and end dates."]},{"l":"Problem lists","p":["OpenMRS lets you manually maintain a Problem List for a patient. This list is managed separately from Observations: observing that the patient has \"Diagnosis Present = Diabetes\" does not automatically add a problem to the list. Unlike an observation (which happens at one moment in time), a problem is longitudinal data, with start and end dates."]},{"i":"program-enrollments-workflows-and-states","l":"Program enrollments, workflows, and states","p":["A Program represents an administrative program or study that a patient may be enrolled in (for example, Child Nutrition Study or DOTS Tuberculosis Treatment Program).","A Program Enrollment represents the fact that a patient is enrolled in one of these programs over a time period at a Location. This is longitudinal data with a start date and end date.","A Program can also define administrative Workflows, and possible States the patient may have within those workflows. An Initial State is one that a patient is allowed to start in when they are first enrolled in a program. A Terminal State is one that closes the program enrollment if the patient is placed in it.","For example a research study on infant nutrition might have a workflow called Study Enrollment Status with the states:","Patient Identified (initial)","Mother Consented to Study","Study Complete (terminal)","Lost to Followup (terminal)","These states are meant to represent administrative statuses, not clinical ones. For example putting a patient in a Loss to Followup state represents an official declaration and will not happen automatically even if no encounters are entered for the patient for several months."]},{"l":"Forms","p":["A Form represents an electronic form that may be used for entering or viewing data. The basic OpenMRS system does not define a specific technology for entering forms. You will need to use one of the community-developed form entry modules.

If you want a patient to be able to view her own record in OpenMRS, then you need to create a user account and link it to the patient.","A Role represents a group of privileges in the system. Roles may inherit privileges from other roles, and users may have one or more roles.","A Privilege is an authorization to perform a particular action in the system.

Different types of identifiers are distributed by various health care systems. Some of these systems will be within your control, so you will be able to control how identifiers are created and distributed; however, there will likely be identifiers that are not within your control but are useful to record within your system to aid in patient identification.","In order to see predefined identifier types, or to add a new one, go to Administration - Manage Identifier Types. Let's examine OpenMRS Identification Number.","The Regex Format and Description of format fields are empty, but you could add here a regular expression to validate each entered identifier. For example:","would allow 1 to 8 digits followed by a dash and a single digit.","It is also possible to choose one of several pre-defined Identifier validators. Here Luhn CheckDigit Validator is used. The purpose of check digits is simple. Any time identifiers (typically number +/- letters) are being manually entered via keyboard, there will be errors. Inadvertent keystrokes or fatigue can cause digits to be rearranged, dropped, or inserted.","Check digits helps to reduce the likelihood of errors by introducing a final digit that is calculated from the prior digits. Using the proper algorithm, the final digit can always be calculated. Therefore, when a number is entered into the system (manually or otherwise), the computer can instantly verify that the final digit matches the digit predicted by the check digit algorithm. If the two do not match, the number is refused. The end result is fewer data entry errors."]},{"l":"Internationalization","p":["Concepts can be easily internationalized; that is you can enter different concept names for every allowed locale.

There is nothing to prevent you from omitting a clause, such as to ensure you are only looking at non-voided data.","In this example we are searching for all patients who have carried at least 4 pregnancies.","Since SQL flags must include .patient_id in their select clause, we have to join the obs table against the patient table, even though we aren't using that table."]},{"l":"Groovy flags","p":["The most powerful type of flag allows you to write Groovy or Java code, which can call OpenMRS's Java API and perform complex calculations on patient data. The advantage of writing flags in Groovy is that the OpenMRS API takes care of details like ensuring you are only getting non-voided data. The limitation is that most managers of OpenMRS systems do not know how to write Groovy/Java code.","A Groovy flag returns a cohort of all patients that match the calculation. In this example we find all patients who are expected to give birth in the next 3 months, but who have_not_had an encounter in the last 3 months."]}],[{"l":"Administering OpenMRS"}],[{"l":"User Management and Access Control","p":["Roles and Privileges are controlled through the Administration page, under the Manage Users section.","OpenMRS uses privileges and roles to control access to data within the system. Privileges define what can or cannot be done in the system (e.g., Edit Patients or Add Users), while roles are used to group privileges into more manageable groupings. To make the system easier to manage, roles can contain other roles as well as privileges. Roles inherit all the privileges of their parent roles.","We will use this example: you are working with several privileges related to patient data—e.g., View Patients, Edit Patients, and Add Patients. TheView Patientsprivilege lets users look at patients in the system, the Edit Patients privilege lets users edit information about existing patients, and the Add Patients privilege allows users to create a completely new patient record within the system.","Now imagine that you need to assign the proper rules to three people: Mary the Medical Student, Bob the Data Assistant, and Erica the Data Manager. You want medical students to be able to view patients, but not edit or add them. Data assistants should be able to not only view, but also edit patient data. And you want your data managers to be able to create new patients within your system."]},{"l":"Designing role and privilege schemes","p":["In order to give these privileges to the relevant users, you must define a role for each of these types of user.","Now, by defining the main roles for users of your system and assigning users to those roles, you have a much easier system to manage and users will automatically inherit all privileges given to their role(s). Of course, some users will have multiple roles. Now, let's take this process one step further. While it may not seem necessary in this simple example, as your system grows, you will likely end up with a large number of different roles. Very often, certain roles can be defined as a combination of other roles. In our example, a Data Manager oversees the Data Assistants and therefore should have all of their privileges plus some additional privileges. So, let's redesign our roles slightly to show how this might work.","You can see that the Data Manager role can be more clearly defined as a Data Assistant with the extra ability to add patients to the system. In addition, if you should change or enhance the privileges of the Data Assistant role at any time in the future, the Data Manager will automatically adapt to those changes — for example, if you decided a month later to allow any Data Assistant to Edit Encounters(by adding the Edit Encounters privilege to the Data Assistant role), the Data Manager role would automatically gain the ability to edit encounters as well.","In a common deployment scenario, you will have several roles that use the same privileges with only a few differences. It is simpler to manage these privileges by defining a new role from which the others can all inherit. For example, you may have roles like Clinician, Data Assistant, and Caregiver that all have the same rules about viewing patient data. You might benefit from creating a new Patient Data Viewer role, assigning it to each of those other roles, and then managing the privileges in one place (under that new role). When there is a policy change about viewing patient data, or a new module is added that adds new functions for viewing data, you would update the Patient Data Viewer role. All the inheriting roles would automatically use the new settings."]},{"l":"Built-in roles","p":["There are some special roles that are predefined within OpenMRS and cannot be deleted: Anonymous, Authenticated, and System Developer. Any privileges granted to the Anonymous role will be available to people without logging into the system. Generally, Anonymous privileges should be kept very restricted, since patient information might otherwise be compromised. Privileges granted to the Authenticated role are granted to anyone that logs into your system, no matter what other role(s) they might be assigned. Granting privileges to the Authenticated role is an easy way to grant privileges to all users of the system. The System Developer role is automatically granted full access to the system and should only be granted to system administrators.","Super users(system administrators) are automatically granted all privileges in the system; therefore, you must be very careful to protect your system administrator password.","Some privileges are built into the system and cannot be deleted. Other privileges may be added by modules. It is unlikely that you will be adding new privileges yourself, since privileges are only useful when they are understood and used by the system. On the other hand, you will definitely be creating new roles to fit your needs and will be managing privileges within those roles."]},{"l":"Creating roles","p":["You create roles through Administration > Manage Roles.","Allows to add a new role","Lists all roles present in the system","Click a role to edit it.","If you then follow the Add Role link, you will see a form for adding a new role.","Enter Role Name","Choose Roles Privileges of which you want to inherit","Choose Privileges which you want this Role to have"]},{"l":"Creating users","p":["To create these users, we'll go through Administration > Manage Users.

Forms usually include a dropdown box to select a provider.","The system administrator must explicitly identify Providers. This is done through Administration > Providers > Manage Providers.","There are two kinds of providers. In OpenMRS 1.8 and earlier, a provider had to be associated with a user or, less often, a patient. The administrator had to create a user, and then search for them with the Person dropdown box. This is most useful when a provider has a user login.","At many OpenMRS sites, only a few users log into the system. Often, treatment notes are entered by data clerks after an encounter, and clinicians never log in. Perhaps there are hundreds of providers who volunteer at the clinic only briefly. From OpenMRS 1.9 on, these providers can be entered as a name, and a user login is not required.","For system security, patient privacy, and ease of maintenance, it's best to enter providers only as a Provider Name when possible. You should create a user if the provider needs to log in or be given special permissions through a role. You can assign a user to a provider at a later time if it becomes necessary.","To create a Provider, go to Admin > Manage Providers and click Add Provider.","The identifier is a unique word or number that you provide. It's recommended that you create identifiers in a way that's simple and easy, such as using the provider's last name and first name.","Next, decide if this provider will be associated with a Person, or only be entered as a provider name. If you choose the Person style, you must have already created a User for them. Begin typing their name in the Person field, and select them from the auto-complete list of matching users.

However, there are some specific items to consider when backing up your OpenMRS server.","Most importantly, you need to create a backup strategy for your MySQL database. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is by using the mysqldump utility that ships with the database. Ideally, you will want to shut down OpenMRS before backing up, and restart it once the backup has completed. If you are not able to do so, or wish to have the system remain in a \"read-only\" mode, you may want to use the options of mysqldump to lock tables.
